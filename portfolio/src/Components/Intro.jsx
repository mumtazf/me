                    <p>Iâ€™m a CS student with a focus in ML. As a part of my ML fellowship at MIT, <br/> I learned that I enjoy integrating ML models with products. <br/><br/>
    As a rising junior in college, I enjoy tinkering with different technologies. <br/> I realize that there is a breadth of knowledge out there so I keep myself open to learning new things.
                    I'm currently learning React and this website is a product of my learning journey.</p>
